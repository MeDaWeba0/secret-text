# secret-text
 
this program is a text encrypter, to keep our text files safe.
The program could be used to write down passwords without being afraid that someone might see them or to hide your biggest secrets ðŸ˜‰.

# To use

When you open the program, you will see a window with various holes and buttons.

"Encrypting numbers"
You must enter 3-digit numbers being a decimal, those two numbers will be the ones used for text encryption, therefore you have to use them every time you go to open a file, if you leave the space blank the default ones will be used, This is more secure than using a normal "txt" but it is not completely secure because anyone can enter.

"File name"
Here you must enter the name of the file to save/load without any extension, for example it would be "name" and not "name.txt".

Now we are going to review the buttons

"Load"
When this button is pressed, the file with the name in the "File name" box is searched and the two "Encryption Numbers" are used to decrypt it and finally it is opened.

Once open it can be edited in the text editing window.

"Save"
When this button is pressed, the text file is saved with the name in the "File name" box, encrypted with the "Encrypting Numbers" and with the extension ".mw".
